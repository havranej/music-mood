# Music Mood to Light Color

A responsive light changing its color to match the mood of your music. Powered by neural networks (running on laptop) & Arduino. See it in action [here](https://youtu.be/xi0QlckEt9w).

Result of a final project for ML course 2020/2021. For technical details, see the [report](report.pdf). 

## Environment

The [environment](app/environment.yml) file should contain everything you need to run the app, except for [pyAudioAnalysis](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis) library, which needs to be installed manually. You can run the app without Arduino, if you omit the `--port` parameter.
